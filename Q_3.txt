Factors on which sale of Red Honda SUV depends:
1.Average Income per capita
2.Pricing
3.Sale may vary from region to region , eg. Regions with high temperatues during summers wouldn't want red car as it gets very hot inside
4. Mileage
5.Availability of Honda Service centre nearby
6.Availibility of orignal honda parts
7.Money spent on advertisement of the model 
8.Availibility of Smart features in that model
9.No. of airbags in that car compared to its counterparts


The application of which model I should implement depends on size of the data and kind of features that are avilable to me.
In general if it is a small dataset then I would like to use Linear Regression but provided for better result the features should be normally distributed .
Or the model that workd best genrally are the tree based models like Random Forest, Xgboost .You can hypertune them to decrease overfitting to a large extent. But these models genrally require a large dataset or they completely overfit the data and lack any predictive value.


I would divide the dateset into train and test and a validation set. Clean the data , remove all the outliers or bound them to a maximum value i.e 3 times mean or 3 times median . Then in the final stage I would input train dataset and find its accuracy on the validation set by testing on various available models. If I am satisfied with the best model performence on Validation set then I would perform a run the model then I would run it on the test set.
