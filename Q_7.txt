Recently I had done a project regression task where we had to predict the life expectancy of a country . The dataset had nearly 3 lakh enteries .I t contained the data of around all the countries,islands around the world over 15 years period.
1. The first think that I did was split the data into train and test.  
2. Find the missing variables in the data
3. Since Categorcal data didn't contain any missing values I encoded them. Major problem was coming from country column if they were encoded they would have high cardinality andit would spoil the predicting value od my dataset , so I converted it into continent column.
4. I removed the rows with more tham 4 columns missing out of the 14 columns prsent at that time.
5. Filled themissing data in each column with the mean of the data for that country
6. Since there were many outliers in the data so rather than removing them I encoded them to the maximum of 3*(quantile(0.75)-quantile(0.25))+ quantile(0.75) value.It also helped to increase the co-relation of the columns to the final output.
7. Normalized the cotinuous variables y using various transformation like log,power,yeo-johnson etc.
8. Then The continues variables that were not normalized I discretized them.
9. Tested the dataset on the various models so as to find the best MSE eg. Linear Model, Random Forest, Decission Tree, Xgboost .
10. I also used Randomized search and then Grid Search C to decraese overfitting.
